Multinational businesses face increasing scrutiny from tax authorities as ever-changing guidelines broaden regulatory requirements.\n\n**Transfer pricing experience**\n\nOur transfer pricing services team has extensive experience providing professional tax services to U.S. and private equity and venture capital funds.  Our dedicated team has significant experience and industry knowledge that allows us to provide clients with strategic transfer pricing advisory and value-added solutions to meet their ongoing international tax and transfer pricing needs.\n\n**Global Transfer Pricing Documentation**\n\nIncreased scrutiny by tax authorities across the globe has highlighted the importance of properly documented transfer pricing arrangements. Companies with inadequate documentation are subject to severe financial penalties during audits.  As part of its BEPS Action Plan, the OECD has introduced recommendations and increased transfer pricing documentation requirements. Our team will work with you to not only meet compliance requirements but also to comprehensively assess and plan for potentially unforeseen transfer pricing issues by providing services such as:\n\n* Assessment of current transfer pricing documentation (e.g., master file, local file, intercompany agreements, etc.) for sufficiency and revisions as necessary.\n* Preparation of customized benchmark studies to determine reasonable intra-group prices.\n\n**Transfer pricing solutions**\n\n**Transfer pricing planning and advisory**\n\nTax authorities are increasingly vigilant regarding base erosion and profit shifting and insist that intra-group transactions be at arm's length.  We work closely with clients of all sizes to understand their situations and transform their transfer pricing concerns into opportunities and solutions. With international taxation a major issue facing multinational enterprises and individuals, we offer assistance with the following:\n\n* Preparing and reviewing transfer pricing policies compliant with all applicable tax jurisdictions and OECD BEPS Action Plan requirements.\n* Establishing transfer pricing documentation guidelines.\n* Advising on special transfer pricing issues, including: support for valuing intangibles, establishing tax-aligned supply chains, identifying and potentially mitigating permanent establishments, support for personnel secondments, and tax and transfer pricing support related to intra-group financing.\n\n**Tax audit and dispute support**\n\nTransfer pricing investigations are often stressful and mismanaged audits can result in double taxation, interest, and penalties.  We work closely with clients to address these challenges with a dedicated team.\n\n**Business restructuring**\n\nBusiness restructuring should be undertaken following the arm's length principle. Both tangible and intangible assets transferred across jurisdictions during restructurings must be valued defensibly.  Intercompany agreements must clearly reflect arm's length pricing and clarify all related functions to ensure compliance.  Non-compliance can result in significantly increased tax liabilities.

Experts evaluate a company's financial and operational health to confirm the buyer's or lender's investment strategy. This involves analyzing financial performance, potential synergies, and the accuracy of reported earnings to pinpoint transaction risks.  Thorough due diligence is crucial for successful transactions, accurately assessing the value of potential acquisitions and investments.  The process examines factors like earnings quality, operations, market trends, company culture, and other aspects to evaluate risks and determine true company value.  The specialists aim to maximize client value and streamline the process.\n\nThe primary goals of due diligence are validating the buyer's or lender's investment strategy, verifying assumptions made during negotiations, uncovering potential issues and opportunities, and providing data for post-transaction planning.  Key areas examined include earnings quality, asset quality, debt and contingent liabilities, related-party transactions, commercial aspects, human resources, and customer feedback.\n\nVendor due diligence mirrors buyer-side due diligence but is performed before a sale.  This helps management prepare for buyer/lender questions, organize documents for financial, tax, and legal reviews, and anticipate potential negotiation issues.  Benefits for sellers include proactively identifying and addressing issues or providing explanations, creating a more favorable impression for buyers, and speeding up the sale process, ultimately increasing the chance of a successful transaction.

They need to ascertain the startup's true value, growth potential, and any hidden risks before committing significant capital.\n\n**How Due Diligence Helps:**\n\n1. **Quality of Earnings Analysis:**\n    *   The due diligence team can analyze the startup's revenue streams, customer acquisition costs, and churn rates to determine the sustainability and quality of its earnings. They can identify if the revenue is recurring or dependent on one-time projects or contracts, which can greatly affect the quality of revenue.\n    *   They can also assess the impact of any accounting policies or adjustments that might be inflating reported earnings.\n2. **Technology and IP Assessment:**\n    *   Specialists can evaluate the startup's technology stack, intellectual property portfolio, and potential for future innovation.

For a tech startup, this is very important to justify the valuation of the company, as this forms the backbone of the product/service.\n3. **Market Analysis:**\n    *   The due diligence process will involve a thorough analysis of the startup's target market, competition, and growth potential. This can involve customer surveys and talking to key stakeholders within the ecosystem, like vendors and regulators, to gauge the pulse of the market.\n    *   This helps validate the firm's investment thesis regarding market size and opportunity.

The ability to scale operations while maintaining good margins will be the ultimate test for the company as it grows, and this needs to be accounted for in the assessment.\n5. **Regulatory and Legal Compliance:**\n    *   Due diligence will uncover any legal or regulatory risks, such as pending litigation, compliance issues, or data privacy concerns.\n    *   This ensures that the firm is not exposed to unforeseen liabilities after the acquisition.

They need to maximize the sale price and ensure a smooth transaction.\n\n**How Vendor Due Diligence Helps:**\n\n1. **Pre-Sale Issue Identification and Remediation:**\n    *   Vendor due diligence identifies potential issues that could negatively impact the sale price or scare away potential buyers. For instance, financial irregularities or over-inflated numbers in the books, or potential pending litigations that are not yet public.\n    *   The corporation can address these issues proactively, such as resolving legal disputes, improving financial reporting, or restructuring operations, before initiating the sale process.\n2. **Data Room Preparation:**\n    *   The due diligence team helps organize and prepare comprehensive financial, legal, and operational data for the data room.\n    *   This ensures that potential buyers have access to well-structured and reliable information, facilitating their own due diligence efforts, and improving the pace of the negotiations. This helps them to avoid any surprises once the transaction is completed.\n3. **Negotiation Support:**\n    *   By anticipating potential buyer concerns and preparing detailed responses, the corporation is better positioned to negotiate favorable terms and defend the desired sale price. For example, if the vendor due diligence identifies a potential risk, the management can provide mitigating circumstances that justify the risk, and hence the negotiated price.\n    *   This reduces the risk of price reductions or deal termination due to buyer-discovered issues late in the process.\n4. **Management Preparedness:**\n    *   Vendor due diligence helps the management team prepare for buyer inquiries and presentations.\n    *   This creates a positive impression of a well-managed and transparent business, increasing buyer confidence, and improving chances of the deal being successful.\n5. **Faster Transaction Timeline:**\n    *   A well-executed vendor due diligence process can significantly speed up the sale process by streamlining buyer due diligence and reducing negotiation time. This allows the management to spend their time more effectively.\n    *   This minimizes business disruption and allows the corporation to realize the proceeds from the sale more quickly."
