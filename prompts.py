<planning_guide>
Step 1: Initial Review and Categorization
    Goal: Quickly assess the relevance of the trigger event to your industry.
    Actions:
        • Analyze the regulation's description:
            - What sector or activity does it target? (e.g., lending, investment advisory, payments).
            - Is it geography-specific or global in nature?
        • Categorize by type of impact:
            - Compliance/Operational (e.g., reporting requirements).
            - Financial/Revenue (e.g., taxes or fees).
            - Risk-related (e.g., cybersecurity breaches).
        • Use a decision tree to classify:
            - Relevant: Continue detailed assessment.
            - Irrelevant: Log and archive for future reference.

Step 2: Detailed Impact Analysis
    Goal: Deep-dive into the regulatory trigger and assess its impact on your company.
    Actions:
        • Break down the regulation into components:
            - What are the key provisions (e.g., penalties, timelines, required actions)?

            - Geographic presence: Does it apply in regions where you operate?
        • Engage subject-matter experts (SMEs) from compliance, legal, tax, and operations for validation.

Step 3: Risk Assessment
    Goal: Quantify the risk posed by the trigger event.
    Actions:
        • Evaluate the risk using these parameters:
            - Financial impact: Costs of compliance vs. penalties for non-compliance.
            - Reputation impact: Public perception if non-compliance is exposed.
            - Operational disruption: Effort to implement required changes.
        • Assign a risk level:
            - High (urgent action required).
            - Medium (monitor and plan action).
            - Low (minimal/no impact).
        • Prioritize based on potential business disruption.

Step 4: Opportunity and Threat Identification
    Goal: Determine whether the regulation creates opportunities or threats.
    Actions:
        • Look for business opportunities:
            - Can your company leverage expertise to assist clients in compliance?
            - Can you create new products/services aligned with the regulation?
        • Identify threats:
            - Are competitors better positioned to adapt?
            - Will the regulation require divestment or exit from certain markets?
        • Propose recommendations for decision-makers.

Step 5: Stakeholder Mapping
    Goal: Identify who needs to know and act upon the findings.
    Actions:
        • Map the relevant stakeholders:
            - Compliance: Regulatory alignment.
            - Operations: Process changes.
            - Finance: Budgetary impact.
            - Technology: System upgrades.
            - Business units: Product/service modifications.
        • Prepare a summary report with:
            - Regulation overview.
            - Impact assessment.
            - Recommended actions.
            - Timelines and deadlines.

Step 6: Action Plan and Tracking
    Goal: Implement necessary changes and monitor for further developments.
    Actions:
        • Develop an action plan:
            - What needs to be done (e.g., audits, process changes)?
            - Who is responsible?
            - What are the deadlines?
        • Create a tracking system:
            - Status updates (pending/in progress/completed).
            - Dependencies and bottlenecks.
            - Budget tracking (if applicable).

However, the IRA's complexity, evolving guidance, and compliance requirements present challenges.  Assistance is available to navigate these complexities and maximize credit eligibility.

Recent developments include the release of final regulations for the section 48 tax credit and proposed guidance for clean electricity production and investment tax credits (sections 45Y and 48E).  The 2024 election results have introduced uncertainty regarding the future of IRA credits, urging project owners to remain proactive.
